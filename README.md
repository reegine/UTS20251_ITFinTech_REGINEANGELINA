# 🍰 Gine’s Dessert Shop  

A simple dessert shop website built for **IT in Financial Services**, made by **Regine Angelina Halim (23502310025)**.  

This project demonstrates the integration of **Xendit Payment Gateway** with a **MongoDB** backend. Users can:  
- Browse the dessert menu  
- Search by keywords or categories  
- Select one or more items  
- Checkout and simulate payments with Xendit  

⚠️ **Note**: Payments are fully simulated using Xendit’s sandbox environment, so no real money is used.  

The website is deployed using **Vercel**:
